## Github Codespaces
To run cli commands in this workshop we need to have access to a terminal that has the required software installed. As the workshop participants has diverse environments, instead of spending time figuring out nuance of different environments and how to make them work with asa-e,for this workshop we are going to use the Codespaces feature offered by Github. This comes with VSCode and an integrated terminal that has all the required software with appropriate versions to run the workshop.

The requirement to get Codespaces enabled for you is to get your gitid added to github.com/Azure-Samples. From your side, you need to provide your github id to the workshop facilitator and they will do the needful to enable Codespaces for your git account. Once the workshop facilitator adds you to the github org, you will receive an invitation to join the Org. After you accept the invitation, you should see Codespaces option enabled. Below screenshot shows a sample of Codespaces enabled.
